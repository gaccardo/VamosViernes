This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/jquery-countdown/ as the original author hasn't updated the project since 10th July 2009.

Please see http://pfarmer.github.com/jquery-countdown/test.html for examples of how to setup different countdowns, documentation is coming shortly.

h2. Improvements from the original code base:

* startTime can be dd:hh:mm:ss or a date object.
* Automatically detect format of startTime.
* Zero pad numbers if needed.

h2. Please add a link in the wiki to your site if you use this jQuery plugin.
